# BAD DRIVERS PROJECT

## Dataset: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bad-drivers
### This dataset contains information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners from 2009 to 2012. Data includes fatal collisions due to certain causes, car insurance premiums, and losses incurred by insurance companies for collisions.

## Part 1: Answering the following questions --> code found in bad-drivers-part1.md
### Question 1: What states and geographical regions have the highest number of car accidents? --> graph output: accidents-vs-state.png
### Question 2: Is there a relationship between insurance company losses and driver insurance premiums? --> graph output: collisions-vs-area.png

## Part 2: Creating an interactive Shiny App of a graph --> code found in bad-drivers-part2.md
### Questions:
###   - What geographic regions and states have the highest number of drivers in fatal collisions per billion miles?
###   - Can I compare various regions or states with each other based on number of drivers in fatal collisions per billion miles?
###   - Can I see what states are grouped into low, medium, and high levels of drivers in fatal collisions per billion miles?
